## Image Classification using Pytorch
This is a simple example of PyTorch for Image Classification using Neural Networks.
The goal is to using the CIFAR10 dataset to classify elements in 10 different classes: plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck. It's just the first test for beginners.

The folowwing steps will be taken:
<li>Loading CIFAR10 dataset;
<li>Creating a Neural Network and parameters
<li>Training the Network
<li>Testing the Network
    
>The codes and methodology were extracted innitially from PyTorch documentation. [Link here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#define-a-convolutional-neural-network)
